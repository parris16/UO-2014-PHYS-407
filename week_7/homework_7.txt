Seventh Exercise: Advection, part deux.  Due by 10 pm on Thursday May 15.

This assignment should be short to allow you time to start work on your class projects.  The assignment MUST be done individually; no pairing up this time.

1. Based on the Fortran program, week_6/advect.f90, in the class git repository, do the following:

Fix your homework from last week.  You only need to submit the results from the week 6 assignment, part 2a.  If you code in Python, the Fortran example should provide useful tips and allow you to start to understand a little about the Fortran language.

2. Run the Fortran program, week_7/advect.f90, on ACISS. Copy back the results to your computer and plot the results.  Notice that the third-order method with a flux limiter does a much better job of advecting a square pulse.  The flux limiter is constructed in such a way so as to maximize spatial gradients WITHOUT allowing nonphysical results (negative dentities).

You should modify the file, week_7/run_advect.pbs, to change that text to represent your own email and run directory structure.  There is also a file, week_7/load_modules.sh, that you can source to set up your environment for compilation.  Compilation should be done on node hn2 so you will need to source the load_modules.sh file there, for example,

     ssh hn2                  # from the ACISS head node
     source load_modules.sh   # check loaded modules with "module list"

You submit the file with the command

     qsub run_advect.pbs

and you can check the status of the run with the qstat command.

You will need to use the scp command to copy files to and from ACISS.  I suggest you run the scp command from your local computer, for example,

    scp file_name your_login_name@aciss.uoregon.edu:file_name

Good luck!
